"I am providing 6 JSON files for the curriculum content. Please note the following critical technical requirements for rendering:

Math Rendering (Critical): The JSON text contains LaTeX-style math tokens (e.g., alpha_bar_t, sqrt(1 - beta), q(x_t | x_0)). You must use a library like KaTeX or MathJax on the frontend to render these as proper mathematical formulas. Do not display raw text like sigma^2.

Parsons Problem UI (Section B):

The scrambled_code_blocks are Python snippets.

The UI must be a Drag-and-Drop interface.

The user must drag the blocks into the correct vertical order.

Your validation logic must compare the user's order against the correct_order array in the JSON.

AI Grading (Section C):

When sending the user's Theory Answer to the Grok API, you must include the ai_grading_rubric object from the JSON in the system prompt.

Prompt Example: 'You are the grader. Here is the question. Here is the Student's Answer. Here is the Rubric (JSON data). Grade the student from -1 to 4 based strictly on this rubric.'"
